The manifesto (in short):

*Individuals and interactions over processes and tools*
*Working software over comprehensive documentation*
*Customer collaboration over contract negotiation*
*Responding to change over following a plan*

*That is, while there is value in the items on*
*the **right**, we value the items on the **left** more.*

### Discussion

The manifesto for agile software development is really a critique of the way many western organizations tend to write software and do business.

- The things on the "right" in the manifesto is Taylorism. Taylorism ([Scientific Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_management)) focuses on constraint, empirical measurement, risk management, predictability through repeatable process, (over) simplification, automation, rigid abstractions and the betterment of the processes in an organization. Though Taylorism often crushes the individual, it also aids with harmony, control and sometimes efficiency. In the extreme, this line of thought leads to structured heirachies, centralization, waterfall projects, [planned economies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_economy) and authoritarian **Order**.
- The things on the "left" in the manifesto is [Wu Wei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_wei). Wu Wei focuses on freedom, communication, vision, creativity, craftsmanship, agility and betterment of the individual that in turn helps the collective. It understands that humans create abstractions that are too general and often get in the way of people doing the right things or thinking for themselves. Wu Wei aids leadership and innovation by unblocking obstacles. In the extreme, this line of thought leads to flat heirachies, decentralization, cowboy coding, [spontaneous order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_order) and anarchistic **Chaos**.

The manifesto states that while the things on the right matter, we should value the things on the left more. The manifesto is a statement of common sense. Things go bad when there's too much planning and management. Vision, innovation and leadership are the primary forces of what drives the world forward, not management. It also says that it needs both things to work - but balance is hard to achieve when the purpose of management is to maintain control rather than acting as [servant leaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership).

Of the popular agile frameworks, Scrum seems to have applied ideas of the way armies operate to its process. Army-like practices such as the scrum master, sprints, swarming, goal setting, and burndowns through estimation, help give commanding officers the warm and fuzzies while keeping the grunts focused. At the ground level, the team needs to make their own decisions so they don't get killed in action, but the whole operation must be managed in a risk managed, logistical and strategic way.

Alternatively, Lean (using Kanban and Lean principles) draws more on inspiration from Zen Buddhism (influenced in this area by Taoism) reflecting the [TPS process pioneered by Toyota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Production_System). In this way, it is closer to Wu Wei than Scrum. You may want to ask yourself when choosing between the two - are your team master ninjas or unthinking grunts that may need micromanaging with daily standups, sprint reviews and burndowns?

More interestingly, the manifesto for agile software development owes its roots to Taoism (via Zen Buddhism) thanks to [Ikujiro Nonaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikujiro_Nonaka) and [Hirotaka Takeuchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirotaka_Takeuchi#The_New_New_Product_Development_Game). [Alan Watts once said](https://alanwatts.org/1-2-10-taoist-way-pt-2/):

"The Taoist is the kind of person that shows you the shortcut, and shows you how to do it by intelligence rather than effort. Taoism in that sense is what everyone is looking for, the easy way in - the shortcut, using cleverness instead of muscle."

Taoism is about the individual and the freedom to use intelligence, Confucianism (like Scientific Management) is about keeping order and harmony so things don't fall apart - "That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more."

**If you choose to develop in an agile way, you must know and use intelligent shortcuts and this is what GitFeatures intends to help you with.**
