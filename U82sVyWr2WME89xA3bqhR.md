Learning how and when to plan, and what may require example maps can be helped by using something like the Cynefin framework.

- estimate complexity - chaotic, complex, complicated, clear
- no idea where to start? - chaotic... just take action
- unknown unknowns... complex, use example mapping and prototyping
- complicated... standard backlog item, feature, story, scenario, code
- clear... bang out something using patterns and best practices

great talk: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2X_7ojZwtU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2X_7ojZwtU)

- vision
- goal
- capability (backlog item - starts with a verb)
- feature
- story
- scenario
- code

... only works in the complicated domain, not the complex (you need example mapping and discovery for that).

... video talks about "creating options" when you move out of the complex space. Options help deliver things faster and better.

The things on the left (Chaos, Complex) are more important than the things on the right (Complicated, Clear). The things on the left require good people - the things on the right require good process.

Risk is where the value is - otherwise it's just a commodity.

Also - apply the complex domain to reflexivity - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zX1nm6PoI-g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zX1nm6PoI-g) - how can reflexivity influence the success of the feature?
