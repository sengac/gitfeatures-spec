Critical thinking, ownership through recognition and a clear definition of roles are often sorely missing in the western world. You may be familiar with the following terms:

- Handoffs
- ðŸ’© shields
- Weasels
- Scapegoats
- Managerial feudalism
- Managers smelling the roses
- Ivory tower syndrome

Why does that sound so familiar? Organizations have a tendency to become more and more heirachical over time. This can eventually lead to a cycle of redundancies and hiring. It's one of the many symptoms of Scientific Management going wrong.

The HBO TV series, "Chernobyl", depeicted this. It implied that Lenin's adoption of Scientific Management was the root cause of the catastropic failure to properly handle the incident. Much of the same can be said when similar incidents occur in organizations - there's always a scapegoat to blame when the system doesn't work properly.

Without the ability to openly and transparently critique a system, who would want to own anything in such a system?
