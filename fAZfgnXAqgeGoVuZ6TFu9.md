"What makes work really satisfying, Epicurus believed, is either working alone or in very small groups and when it feels meaningful, when we sense that weâ€™re helping others in some way or making things that improve the world." - https://epicurus.today/epicurus-the-simplest-philosopher-to-understand/

For this reason, small "products" are the best thing an individual or team can achieve.
