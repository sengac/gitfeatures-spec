- Most software development is a creative art, not a science
- Working in the industry is a pain, everyone has an opinion on what to do and how to do it - things often fail
- Methods like Specification by Example have been around for over 10 years, but still rarely used
- Forget about the Agile industrial complex
- Guide people with *simple* tools, methods and examples
- Mind mapping to get your ideas out
- Git version control for transparency and ubiquity
- Acceptance criteria because people need to know what to do
- Check the validity of what you've developed
