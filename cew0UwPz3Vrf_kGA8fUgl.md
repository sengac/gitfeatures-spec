Failing to plan is planning to fail, but planning too early is failing to plan correctly. Instead, focus on goals. Lean kanban tends to focus on just-in-time for highly-skilled teams, scrum tends to focus on goal setting through swarming and sprints. Both generally delay planning, but a lot of people don't know how to do planning in these models. When and where are the plans made and stored? How are the plans validated?
