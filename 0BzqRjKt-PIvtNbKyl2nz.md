The manifesto (in short):

*Individuals and interactions over processes and tools*
*Working software over comprehensive documentation*
*Customer collaboration over contract negotiation*
*Responding to change over following a plan*

*That is, while there is value in the items on*
*the right, we value the items on the left more.*

### Discussion

The manifesto for agile software development is really a critique of the way many western organizations tend to write software and do business.

- The things on the "right" in the manifesto is Taylorism. Taylorism (Scientific Management) focuses on constraint, empirical measurement, risk management, predictability through repeatable process, (over) simplification, automation, rigid abstractions and the betterment of the processes in an organization. Though Taylorism often crushes the individual, it also aids with harmony, control and sometimes efficiency. In the extreme, this is structured heirachies and authoritarian **Order**.
- The things on the "left" in the manifesto is Flow. Flow focuses on freedom, vision, creativity, craftsmanship, agility and betterment of the individual and collective. It understands that humans create abstractions that are too general and often get in the way of people doing the right things or thinking for themselves. Flow aids leadership and innovation by unblocking obstacles. In the extreme, this is flat heirachies and anarchistic **Chaos**.

The manifesto states that while the things on the right matter, we should value the things on the left more. The manifesto is a statement of common sense. If the people aren't happy and the organization isn't serving its purpose, it's going to fail. It also says that it needs both things to work - but balance is hard to achieve when management only knows or cares about Taylorism.

More interestingly, this manifesto owes its roots to Taoism. Alan Watts once said:

"The Taoist is the kind of person that shows you the shortcut, and shows you how to do it by intelligence rather than effort. Taoism in that sense is what everyone is looking for, the easy way in - the shortcut, using cleverness instead of muscle."

Wu Wei (flow state) is about using intelligence, Confucianism (like Scientific Management) uses muscle. This can clearly be seen in Chinese society - particularly today.

Interestingly, one of the founders of the manifesto and Scrum, [Jeff Sutherland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Sutherland#Military_career), seems to have interpreted this by applying these ideas on the way armies operate. Army-like practices such as the scrum master, sprints, swarming, goal setting, and burndowns through estimation for giving management the warm and fuzzies. At the ground level, the team needs to make their own decisions so they don't get killed in action, but the whole operation must be managed in a risk managed, logistical and strategic way.

Alternatively, Lean (using Kanban and Lean principles) draws more on inspiration from Zen Buddhism (which draws on Taoism) - since Toyota pionered the process. In this way, it is closer to flow than Scrum. You may want to ask yourself when choosing between the two - are your team master ninjas or unthinking grunts that may need micromanaging in daily standups, sprint reviews and burndowns?
