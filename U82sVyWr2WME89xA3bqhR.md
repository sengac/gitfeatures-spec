Learning how and when to plan, and what may require example maps can be helped by using something like the Cynefin framework.

- estimate complexity - chaotic, complex, complicated, clear
- no idea where to start? - chaotic... just take action
- a bit of an idea... use example mapping and prototyping
- complex... 
- clear... bang out something using patterns and best practices

- vision
- goal
- capability (backlog item - starts with a verb)
- feature
- story
- scenario
- code

... only works in the complicated domain, not the complex (you need example mapping and discovery for that).
